Aizul=かつては伝説の宝物庫を守護するサーペントの衛兵の筆頭であったが、彼の寝ている間に泥棒が宝物庫に侵入したことでその地位を失ってしまった。彼は今ダンジョンを這い回り、全ての略奪を行うであろう輩へ復讐せんと欲している。彼は卓越した魔法の使い手であるが、彼と同種のモンスターと同様に近接戦闘は致命的に苦手だ。

# Agnes=This somewhat older looking spriggan carries a bladed staff (almost as large as she is). The pockets of her threadbare robe bulge with jangling coins. The coins and lajatang do not seem to slow her, though, as she darts to and fro, her pockets streaming behind her and trembling as if about to burst.
Antaeus=かつては強大で名の知れたタイタンであったが、自らの尊大さで身を滅ぼした。現在の彼は堕落して悪に染まった、コキュートスの凍った荒地を治める強大なデーモンである。彼の巨大な体躯はあなたが攻撃を当てることが容易であるかのように見えるが、生憎と最も強力なあらゆる手段をもってしても傷を負わせることができないと見ることもできる。
# Antaeus:quote=“That country was then ruled by Antaeus, son of Poseidon, who used to kill strangers by forcing them to wrestle. Being forced to wrestle with him, Hercules hugged him, lifted him aloft, broke and killed him; for when he touched earth so it was that he waxed stronger, wherefore some said that he was a son of Earth.”\n    -Pseudo-Apollodorus , _Library and Epitome_, 2.5.11. ca. 150 BC.\n    trans. Sir James George Frazer, 1913.
Arachne=アラクネはかつて機織りに誰よりも秀でた人間であったが、呪いによって、半身は人、半身は蜘蛛という現在の姿に変えられてしまった。彼女は年をとることも無く、若く美しい人間の女性であるが、ひどく醜い巨大な蜘蛛の脚と腹部を伴った姿をしている。\n\n齢数千にもなる彼女は魔法や数多の計略を身に付けている。彼女のペットがあなたを消化し、体液を飲み尽くす間、蜘蛛の巣や魔法の罠に掛けられることを覚悟せよ。
Asmodeus=炎に取り巻かれた地獄の深層に居を構える偉大なデーモンの一人だ。
# Asmodeus:quote=“For myself, I have other occupations:  I make absurd matches; I marry greybeards with minors, masters with servants, girls with small fortunes with tender lovers who have none. It is I who introduced into this world luxury, debauchery, games of chance, and chemistry. I am the author of the first cookery book, the inventor of festivals, of dancing, music, plays, and of the newest fashions; in a word, I am ASMODEUS, surnamed The Devil on Two Sticks.”\n    -Alain René Le Sage, _Asmodeus: Or, The Devil on Two Sticks_. 1707.
Azrael=強力で、好戦的なイフリートだ。(好戦的じゃないイフリートがいるんですか？)
Blork the orc=著しく太った醜悪なオークだ。 He seems to have scavenged a pair of rainbow-coloured suspenders from somewhere. They're not helping.

Dispater=鉄の都ディースの支配者だ。
# Dispater:quote=“Hoc idem magis ostendit antiquius Iovis nomen: nam olim Diovis et Diespiter dictus, id est dies pater; a quo dei dicti qui inde, et dius et divum, unde sub divo, Dius Fidius. Itaque inde eius perforatum tectum, ut ea videatur divum, id est caelum. Quidam negant sub tecto per hunc deierare oportere. Aelius Dium Fidium dicebat Diovis filium, ut Graeci Dioskopon Castorem, et putabat hunc esse Sancum ab Sabina lingua et Herculem a Graeca. Idem hic Dis pater dicitur infimus, qui est coniunctus terrae, ubi omnia ut oriuntur ita aboriuntur; quorum quod finis ortuum, Orcus dictus.”\n    -Marcus Terentius Varro, _De Lingua Latina_, Liber V, circa 40 BC.
Dissolution=スライムの穴ぐらにはかつて栄えた文明があり、この者はそこで崇拝された神の預言者であった。この都市が現在の住人に侵略されたとき、生き残ったのは彼だけであった。何故なら彼だけはスライムの神に忠誠を誓ったからだ。彼は巨大な毒のある分泌物の塊になったが、彼はまだその知性を保っている。彼は形を保つ者全てへの憎しみに満たされている。
Donald={{\n    local descript = &quot;あなたと同じく、オーブを探す冒険者だ。&quot;\n\n    if you.race() ~= &quot;Merfolk&quot; and you.race() ~= &quot;Octopode&quot; then\n        descript = descript .. &quot; あなたとは違い、しかし&quot;\n    else\n        descript = descript .. &quot;しかし&quot;\n    end\n\n    descript = descript .. &quot;彼はこのことをよく思っていないが、まるで鶏のように水を渡ることができる。&quot;\n\n    return descript\n}}
Dowan=美しいが自惚れの強いエルフだ。彼は魔法への適性があり、その他のことにもそれなりだ。彼の能力は双子の妹デュヴェッサの戦闘技術を完全に補完するためのものだ。

Duvessa=特に変わったところのないエルフの戦士だ。彼女はあらゆる格闘手段に専門的に通じているが、そのために自信過剰になっている。彼女の力は双子の兄ドウェインの魔法の力によって補完される。
# Duvessa:quote=“Twin children: the Girl, she was plain;\n The Brother was handsome & vain;\n ‘Let him brag of his looks,’\n Father said; ‘mind your books!\n The best beauty is bred in the brain.’”\n    -Aesop & Walter Crane, _The Baby’s Own Aesop_, 36: &quot;Brother & Sister&quot;. 1887.
Edmund=嫉妬深い、シグムンドの弟だ(正確には九人兄弟の末っ子だ )。彼はシグムンドのような魔法の力を全く持っていないが、それを戦闘と金儲けの技術で補っている。彼は不運な冒険者を彼の持つ高価なフレイルと頭の回転を以って殺害することで、彼自身の優位性を証明せんと欲している。
# Edmund:quote=“And my invention thrive, Edmund the base\n Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper.—\n Now, gods, stand up for bastards!”\n    -William Shakespeare, _King Lear_, I, ii. 1606.\n\n“When the forces stood in array Edmund proposed to decide their claims by single combat; but Canute saying that he, a man of small stature, would have little chance against the tall athletic Edmund, proposed, on the contrary, for them to divide the realm as their fathers had done.”\n    -Thomas Keightley, _The History of England_. 1839.
# the Enchantress=A beautiful spriggan woman, the ruler of spriggans who live here. She wears an opalescent outfit made of dragon skin that shimmers with all colours.\n\nThe air around her shows hints of many powerful enchantment spells she cast on herself.

Frederick=金縁のモノクルを身につけた、細身の魔法戦士だ。彼は自分にふさわしく、戦うに値する敵を探している。あなたではおそらくお眼鏡に適わないだろう。
# Frederick:quote=“I thoroughly disapprove of duels. I consider them unwise and I know they are dangerous. Also, sinful. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet retired spot and kill him.”\n    -Mark Twain, _Autobiography of Mark Twain_. 1924.
Fannar=高い地位を示すローブに身を包んだ、冷酷なエルフの魔道士だ。彼はダンジョンを静かに歩きながら、不気味なことに自らに囁きかけており、彼の通った後には空気の中に氷の結晶がたなびいている。\n\n遠い昔、ファンナールはその知性と霜の魔法への早熟な才能のお陰で人の羨む執政官の地位につき、エルフの大広間に法を施行する責任者になった。誰に尋ねても彼はかつて慈悲深いことで有名で、事実エルフたちが死霊術や悪魔術に手を染め始めたときでさえ、彼らを堕落や犯罪から遠ざけることにも熱心であった。\n\n幾世紀もの在職期間に、ファンナールの正義に忠実な姿勢は偏執的なものに捻じ曲がってしまい、暴政へと陥ってしまった。彼と最も親密だった支持者ですら現在では、彼の魔力は自滅的なものになり始めたと語っている。ファンナールは現在もエルフたちが邪悪へ手を染めることが無いよう務めている。自覚したくないのか自覚できないのか、彼自信が邪悪へ堕ちているというのに。
Gastronok=貪欲で驚くほど聡明なナメクジだ。彼は頭にとんがり帽子を斜めに被り、出くわしたあらゆるものを食い尽くすことに余念がない。彼はその帽子を彼がその知性と魔法の知識を得たのと同じ方法で手に入れた。－つまり以前の持ち主であった力ある魔法使いを食べることによって。
Geryon=巨大で三つの頭を持ち、羽の生えた大悪魔だ。この者は四つの地獄を守護している。伝説によれば、彼の銀色の角は地獄の門を開くのに用いられるらしい。

Ignacio=定命の者は神の干渉無しには悪魔へと転じることはできないのだが、イグナシオはマクレブが彼の仕事への愛を見て、彼に微笑みかけたことで斯様なものへと変貌した。彼は今現在、彼の人生の楽しみを永遠に続けることを予定している。\n\n彼の新しい姿に躯から生えている多くの鋭い刃があるが、彼は自分のお気に入りの斧を使い続け、その切れ味をあなたで試したいと望んでいる。
Ijyb=小さくて不細工なゴブリンだ。何やら青いぼろを着ている。 He claims dominion over this level of the dungeon; the punishment for trespassing is death.
Ilsuiw=狡猾な水棲の民の水の魔術師だ。彼女はその美貌と魔法の技巧を使い、愚かな冒険者たちに破滅をもたらす。
# Ilsuiw:quote=“We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\n By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\n Till human voices wake us, and we drown.”\n    -T.S. Eliot, _The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock_. lines 129-131. 1915.
Jessica=邪悪な魔女実習生だ。彼女は誰にも邪魔されずに暗黒の力の研究に打ち込める、静かで人目につかない場所を求めてこのダンジョンへとやってきた。
Jorgrun=闇ドワーフの魔術師だ。周囲のダンジョンに実にうまく溶け込んでいる。彼は戦闘において強力な地の魔術を巧みに用いる。
Jory=ジョリーはかつては田舎の百姓であったが、気がつけば不死の強力なモンスターへと変身していた。それ以来無数の世紀を通して、彼は格闘と魔法の技術に磨きをかけ、多くの貴重品と財産を蓄えた。
Joseph=傭兵のようだ。
Josephine=ひどく醜い老婆だ。顔はイボとほくろだらけで、ところどころ毛が生えている。ジョセフィーヌの容姿は見た者を欺き、か弱い老女であると考えさせるかもしれないが、彼女は実に手強い死霊術師なのである。黒魔術の行使は肉体へ被害をもたらし老化を早め、美しい女性であった彼女を醜い老婆へと変えてしまった。
Khufu=神への道の途上にある信じがたいほど強力な王だ。
# Khufu:quote=“And then I looked farther, beyond the pallid line of the sands, and I saw a Pyramid of gold, the wonder Khufu had built. As a golden wonder it saluted me, as a golden thing it greeted me, as a golden miracle I shall remember it.”\n    -Robert Hichens, _The Spell of Egypt_
Kirke=美貌の女魔術師だ。

# Lamia=A powerful queen of the nagas, said to be willing to eat her own children. {{\n  if you.race == &quot;Naga&quot; then\n    return &quot;She is stunningly beautiful.&quot;\n  else\n    return &quot;Despite her deformed body, she is quite beautiful.&quot;\n  end\n}}
# the Lernaean hydra=An ancient, outsized serpent-like water beast that possesses numerous heads. The poets mention more heads than vase-painters can paint, poisonous venom coming out of its eyes, and that this hydra is a guardian of an entrance to the Underworld. What of this is true, you do not know.
# the Lernaean hydra:quote=“The second Labour which he undertook was the slaying of the Lernaian Hydra,\n springing from whose single body were fashioned a hundred necks, each bearing\n the head of a serpent. And when one head was cut off, the place where it was\n severed put forth two others; for this reason it was considered to be\n invincible, and with good reason, since the part of it which was subdued sent\n forth a two-fold assistance in its place. Against a thing so difficult to\n manage as this Herakles devised an ingenious scheme and commanded Iolaos to\n sear with a burning brand the part which had been severed, in order to check\n the flow of the blood.”\n    -Diodorus Siculus, _Bibliotheca Historica_. [4. 11. 5.]. c. 100.
# Lom Lobon=Stoic and inscrutable, Lom Lobon is an ancient demon infamous for his mastery of magic. Rumoured to be the most learned being in the halls of Pandemonium, he is at times sought out by mortal wizards who offer their souls in exchange for the secrets of the arcane. Lacking the terrible wrath present in most demons, Lom Lobon's single eye instead hides a cold, impartial cruelty.
lorocyproca=背が高く痩せさらばえた人型の存在だ。生きているかのようにたなびく長いローブを羽織っている。 It thirsts for magical energies.
# lorocyproca:quote=“There it had assumed a wild, incalculable and incredible shape, twisted into a fantastic arabesque — invisible to their eyes, but dreadful nonetheless — into the unfamiliar numeral under whose menace they lived.”\n    -Bruno Schulz, “The Brilliant Epoch”. 1937.
# lost soul=The echo of a unmourned soul, flickering in and out of the mortal world. Though the memories of its living self are long-faded, it is drawn to the moment of death by some lingering instinct. So powerful is its drive for self and purpose that it seizes upon the passage of other souls, losing the last vestiges of its being in the memories of another's life.
# Louise=A mighty sorceress, clad from head to toe in heavy armour. Once an adventurer looking for the fabled Orb of Zot, she was cast into the Abyss and got hopelessly lost there. Toyed with by some greater power, she was stuck on the hostile plane for nearly a decade. When she finally emerged from the Abyss, Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now wanders the halls of the dungeon, seeking other adventurers to share her fate.
# Mara=This tall and powerful demon is Mara, Lord of Illusions, mighty among dreamers. He is capable of creating intricately detailed illusions, able to mislead even the minds of the mightiest and most brilliant spell-casters.
# Mara:quote=“This night the Lord of Illusion passed among you, Mara, mighty among dreamers, mighty for ill. He did come upon another who may work with the stuff of dreams in a different way. He did meet with Dharma, who may expel a dreamer from his dream. They did struggle, and the Lord Mara is no more. Why did they struggle, deathgod against illusionist? You say their ways are incomprehensible, being the ways of gods. This is not the answer.”\n    -Roger Zelazny, “Lord of Light”, 1967\n\n“He who lives looking for pleasures only,\n his senses uncontrolled, immoderate in his food,\n idle, and weak, Mara will certainly overthrow him,\n as the wind throws down a weak tree.”\n    -The Buddha, _Dhammapada_, 1:7.\n     trans. F. Max Muller

# Maud=A mysterious warrior princess from a far-off kingdom, on a quest to retrieve the legendary sword 'Entarex'. Countless have been the admirers who, thinking about Maud, forgot everything else.
# Maurice=A sly, conniving thief. In his profession, Maurice is considered a legend — at least according to himself. He is skilled, nonetheless, and among all the thieves and rogues lured by the Orb, Maurice is undoubtedly the most crafty.
# Maurice:quote=“'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.”\n    -Charles Dickens, _Oliver Twist_. 1838.
# Mennas=There was once a human priest named Mennas. He travelled far and wide preaching of Zin to any who would listen, going even so far as to travel into Orcish lands, preaching to orcs about laws and mercy. By all accounts the orcs were not happy with Mennas. They demanded he swear Beogh was the one true god, and when Mennas remained silent they cut out his tongue.\n\nWhether or not this angel is that same Mennas is something of a mystery, as he seems to have difficulty speaking.
# Menkaure=A fair and noble ruler of an ancient and mighty kingdom, mummified after an early death. His faithful priests subsequently infused him with great and powerful magic, seeking to grant him eternal life. Now he is forgotten and reduced to mouldering bandages and dry, brittle bones.
# Menkaure:quote=“Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king!\n I go, and I return not. But the will\n Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring\n Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil\n Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,\n The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days.”\n    -Matthew Arnold, _Mycerinus_
Mnoleg=不可思議に輝く人影だ。パンデモニウムの不気味な大気の中を踊っている。

# Norris=A relaxed peace-in-death cultist with a healthy tan and a soothing voice. He doesn't really care if it is you or him who dies — “both” would probably be the best option.
# Norris:quote=“Death and death alone gives meaning to life and this meaning is entirely negative.”\n    -Georges Poulet
# Pikel=While kobolds are normally slaves, Pikel's rough life, selfish ambition and large stature have caused him to rise up and become a slaver himself. He is on his way to the Orcish Mines to sell his wares, a selection of timid humans that cower with every crack of his whip.
# Polyphemus=A cyclops shepherd, he is very protective of his charges, whom he watches with an undying fervor through his single massive eye.
# Polyphemus:quote=“...as soon as he had got through with all his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his morning’s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back again—as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows.”\n    -Homer, _The Odyssey_, Book IX.\n    trans. Samuel Butler, 1900.
# Prince Ribbit=A handsome prince before he was cursed, he now adventures for a cure. On the top of his head he wears a crown tilted jauntily to one side. How it still stays in place even after his transformation is a mystery.
# Prince Ribbit:quote=“Princess! youngest princess!\n Open the door for me!\n Dost thou not know what thou saidst to me\n\n Yesterday by the cool waters of the fountain?\n Princess, youngest princess!\n Open the door for me!”\n    -Brothers Grimm (Margaret Hunt), _The Frog King, or Iron Henry_
# Psyche=A fair-haired mage, wandering and seemingly half-mad with grief and guilt.
# Psyche:quote=“Let Psyche’s corpse be clad in mourning weed\n And set on rock of yonder hill aloft;\n Her husband is no wight of human seed,\n But serpent dire and fierce, as may be thought,\n Who flies with wings above in starry skies,\n And doth subdue each thing with fiery flight.\n The Gods themselves and powers that seem so wise\n With mighty love be subject to his might.\n The rivers black and deadly floods of pain\n And darkness eke as thrall to him remain.”\n    -Apuleius, _Asinus aureus_, “Cupid and Psyche”. circa. 160 AD.\n    trans. William Adlington, 1566.

# Roxanne=A beautiful sapphire statue of a famous earth mage who disappeared after a catastrophic spell failure. She is clutching a book.
# Rupert=A man of very bad manners whose roars can make an ogre envious.
# Saint Roka=A mighty warlord. Some orcs even say he is the Chosen One of Beogh.
# Sigmund=The elder of a pair of brothers who came for the Orb. No one knows what Sigmund saw in the dungeon to drive him mad, but his shrewd magical tactics and wicked scythe now leave little time for his victims to wonder. Despite his reputation as a vicious murderer, his grandiose and dramatic ways have earned him the admiration of many denizens of the dungeon.
# Sigmund:quote=“But Sigmund turned him about, and he said: ‘What aileth thee, son?\n Shall our life-days never be merry, and our labour never be done?’\n\n But Sinfiotli said: ‘I have looked, and lo, there is death in the cup.’\n\n And the song, and the tinkling of harp-strings to the roof-tree winded up;\n And Sigmund was dreamy with wine and the wearing of many a year;\n And the noise and the glee of the people as the sound of the wild woods were\n And the blossoming boughs of the Branstock were the wild trees waving about;\n\n So he said: ‘Well seen, my fosterling; let the lip then strain it out.’”\n    -William Morris, _The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs_. 1891.
# Snorg=A particularly corpulent troll with a short temper and a sizable gut. Uninterested in the Orb, Snorg delights in the endless parade of adventurers – that is, easy meals — it attracts.

# Sojobo=King of the tengu, with legendary skill in swordsmanship, tactics, and magic.
# Terence=A violent murderer who kills for both pleasure and profit, Terence has been forced into hiding after a botched job, and can't really afford to risk letting anyone who has seen him leave the dungeon alive — there is a price on his head, after all.
# Terence:quote=“A MAN committed a murder, and was pursued by the relations of the man whom he murdered. On his reaching the river Nile he saw a Lion on its bank and being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree, and again being greatly alarmed, he threw himself into the river, where a crocodile caught him and ate him. Thus the earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a murderer.”\n    -Aesop, _The Manslayer_. 6th century BCE.\n     trans. George Fyler Townsend
# Tiamat=A powerful dragon with mighty wings. Her scales seem to shimmer and change colour as you watch.
# Tiamat:quote=“He saith that Tiamat our mother hath conceived a hatred for us,\n With all her force she rageth, full of wrath.\n All the gods have turned to her,\n With those, whom ye created, they go at her side.\n They are banded together, and at the side of Tiamat they advance;\n They are furious, they devise mischief without resting night and day.\n They prepare for battle, fuming and raging;\n They have joined their forces and are making war.\n Tiamat who formed all things,\n Made in addition weapons invincible; she spawned monster-serpents,\n Sharp of tooth, and merciless of fang;\n With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.\n Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,\n With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.\n Whoever beheld them, terror overcame him,\n Their bodies reared up and none could withstand their attack.”\n    -Enuma Elish, Third Tablet. circa 668 BCE.
# Urug=A coarse and lanky orc. Urug lost his eye in a fight with a harpy, and has sworn to slay every last one of them.

His impresa was a Catoblepta, which so long lies dead as the moon (whereto it hath so natural a sympathy) wants her light.

All through the Jews quarter he was known as the Golem of the great Rabbi Löw. Every Friday evening the Rabbi took the parchment out of his head, and he was clay until Sunday morning. Once the Rabbi forgot this duty, all were in the Synagogue, the Sabbath hymn was begun, when all the women and children in the assembly started and screamed out, ‘the Golem! the Golem is destroying everything!’ The Rabbi ordered the precentor to pause at the end of the prayer: it was yet possible to save all, but later nought would avail, the whole world would be destroyed.

Verily at the time I shall kill the daughter of the chief will be when the light of day is breaking, and at the same instant the sky will glow with red in the direction whence the morrow comes. 'Ho, there, our comrade has killed her!' will thus be the thought in your hearts. Then is the time when you want to make a great noise, when you shall whoop all keep it up.

The zombie, they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life—it is a dead body which is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive. People who have the power to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time to rot, galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave, occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it like a dumb beast if it slackens.”\n    -William Seabrook, _The Magic Island_. 1929.

# Cigotuvi's Monster:quote=“I beheld the wretch — the miserable monster whom I had\n created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if\n eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.

# conjurer statue=This statue seems to harness the mightiest pure conjurations ever devised by Iskenderun. It is not made in her likeness, as legends describe her as a female felid, but, if I were you, I'd pay more heed to the orbs of magic flying your way than the statue's appearance.
# crystal guardian=This crystal golem is so ensorcelled that it is immune to nearly any magic itself, and it can also shoot powerful beams of fire and cold at any tresspassers.

# malarious mermaid=A young woman with a fish tail in place of legs. She looks quite sick, but still capable of bespelling her audience.

# orb of electricity=A massive floating ball. It resembles ball lightning, but looks far more stable. It definitely lacks some heavy-duty insulation, though.

You'd better stay far away, or you may end up frozen.
# orb slug=A monstrously big slug who apparently ate a mighty conjurer, or maybe an orb spider. Or perhaps it's a product of divine experiments, in which case it looks like Xom's handiwork...

# succubus=A female demon who uses her charms to seduce humanoid males. If you wish to take advantage of her, however, you will fail: she seems very angry right now and has blood more on her mind than fun.
# water elementalist statue=A smooth, charming statue of a beautiful mermaid bathing in a fountain, sculpted from creamy, faintly pinkish travertine. It glistens softly in the light, as if sprinkled in actual water.
# young spriggan druid=A junior member of the order of spriggans sworn to protect nature. While less dangerous than the elders, this one is perfectly capable of dealing with trespassers like you.\n\n{{\n    if you.god() == &quot;Fedhas&quot; then\n        return &quot;Those foul druids care mostly for animals, instead of &quot; ..\n               &quot;taking proper care of plants as Fedhas commands.&quot;;\n    end\n}}
# vine covered stone golem=While made of ordinary old weathered stone, covered with moss and vines, this golem still needs to be respected. It is still hard as stone, after all, and its weight spells massive damage if it connects a blow.
# witch=An old and unnaturally ugly human, wearing robes stained with what appears to be swamp ooze, cauldron soot and brew ingredients.\n\nA magician with such stellar sanity and manners probably has great pets as well. You might not have to wait long to find out for certain.
# witch:quote=“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”\n    -KJV Bible, Exodus 22:18
# withered plant=This plant lost the war against life-draining influences, and yet its physical form is intact. Its dead body stays here uneaten, as the small creatures that would naturally decompose it prefer to stay away. And it looks like this plant died many {{ if you.branch() == &quot;Crypt&quot; or you.branch() == &quot;Tomb&quot; then return &quot;centuries&quot;; else return &quot;years&quot;; end }} ago.
# wizard statue=In this land of magic, it'd be foolish to assume that a statue of a wizard is always an inert piece of rock. This statue's hands and staff have very little dust compared to the base, suggesting it is capable of making magical gestures. The trap is too obvious, but dealing with it might not be.
# zin angel=A divine agent of Zin, it is a towering winged figure with an aura of brilliant white light. This angel's face, though, is marked by a scowl, as if its zeal against any real or perceived vice overshadows its goodness.
# zot statue=An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue is intended to represent some creature or personage, or is completely abstract. One thing is certain: it is profoundly disturbing.
# bag of meat=One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. It is a horrendous imitation of the human form, consisting of an unrecognisable mass of meat stitched together with limbs sewn on seemingly at random. Its skin hangs off loosely in some places and bulges repulsively in others. Each one bears a large symbol carved into its flesh, a mark of pride from its twisted creator.
# large bag of meat=One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its bloated hulk pulsates and throbs constantly with accursed fires. It looks as if it could explode into a torrent of viscera at any moment.
# meat berserker=One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its form is large and muscular. It moves swiftly and with impetuous fury, the sole thought within its being to rend you apart with great fervour. As it rages, it creates a cacophonous din.
# meat hydra=One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Each of its eight necks is distended and elongated, connected to a colossal body crumpled and dripping with ichor. Its many heads spew blood while writhing and convulsing in agony, as it brings torment to itself and anything else that beholds its foul visage.
# meat beast=One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Ablaze with demonic frenzy, it gores and tramples with ferocity unmatched. Its skin is flayed, exposing the glistening tendons and sinew underneath, and the teeth inside its cavernous maw are stained with blood.
# sculptor of flesh=An artisan of unlife, the sculptor appears as a grim skeletal form. It has six long arms ending in mangled hands with broken fingers, upon which it crawls like a spider. Its skull is abnormally large and full of holes. Its bones are reddened and fractured, inscribed with the unholy spells it weaves to assemble its puppets.
# destroyer=The destroyers begin to descend upon you. They come in numbers and with wrath, maws gaping like abaddon, bottomless and abyssal. They bring your doom and will feast on your remains.
# accursed=The accursed are the ones who came before. They have come to ensure you share their fate.
# tyrant=A colossal mass of bones and skulls, a walking tomb. You hear shrieks and screams as it approaches, shattering off bones with each crushing step, reassembling itself in eternal unrest.
# dread=An affront to existence, a void in which there is only torment and hellfire. Its unearthly form is torn and twisted, black and hollow. It is bereft of rational thought, knowing only hatred and the desire to desecrate your soul.
# scourge=A vast serpentine form with raw and diseased skin, seeping bile and pus, spouting venom and blight.
# observer=You see the unseen, you stare and they stare back. They whisper and laugh, they grin and cry, they leer at you with contempt and gaze at you in adoration. They are the observers, they are the judge of your worth and will decide your end.
# meat lost soul=A spectre, struggling to leave the mortal world it is incarcerated in. It drains life and unlife from all those it comes into contact with.
# fleshlord=One of the greatest servants of the Meatlord. It is muscular, agile and full of malevolence.
# vile=An emaciated figure brimming with hellfire and plague. Its appearance signifies the end of days.
# The Servant=His glaive is alight with the flames of hell.
# The Captor=Those who enter will not escape.
# The Defiler=His shield is emblazoned with images of infernal flames.
# The Meatlord=You behold the embodiment of filth, corruption and depravity, the Meatlord. His foul body is bloated to the extreme, leaking viscous fluid and the stench of death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, his mouth is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth disgusting remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging downward. His immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their repugnant release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in protrusions and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous form and your senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity as you choke on the oppressive stench.
# The Unspeakable=You hear the echoes of planets behind the deafening roar of stars as it approaches. It is the jaws of the abyss. It brings forth crawling chaos from within. It is the last sight you will ever see.
