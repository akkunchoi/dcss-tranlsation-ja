# blowgun:quote=“Along the Upper Caiary-Uaupes blow-guns are made from the stems of a variety of palm (Iriartea setigera Martius)... The Indian selects two stems of such sizes that the smaller will exactly fit within the larger. After these stems have been carefully dried and the pith cleared out with a long rod, the bore is made smooth by drawing back and forth through it a little bunch of tree-fern roots. The smaller stem is then inserted in the larger, so that one will serve to correct any crookedness that may exist in the other. The wooden mouth-piece is then fitted to one end, and about three and one half feet from it, a boar's tooth is fastened on the gun by some gummy substance, for a sight. Over the outside the maker winds spirally a strip of the dark shiny bark of a creeper which gives it an ornamental finish, and his blow-gun is complete.\n ”The arrows are from ten to fourteen inches long, and of the thickness of an ordinary lucifer match. Those of the Indians of the Caiary-Uaupes are made from the midrib of a palm leaf or of the spinous processes of the Patawa (Enocarpus Batawa) sharpened to a point at one end and wound near the other with a delicate sort of wild cotton which grows in a pod upon a large tree (Bombax ceiba). This mass of cotton is just big enough to fill the tube when the arrow is gently pressed into it. The point is dipped into poison, allowed to dry, and redipped until well coated. The exact composition of this poison is unknown, and probably varies in different localities; but it would seem that the chief ingredient is always the juice of a Strychnos plant. It is known among different tribes by many names; such as Curari, Ourari, Urari and Woorali.&quot;\n    -C.W. Mead, _The American Museum Journal_, vol. VIII. 1908.

Her rider, Pedro de Moron, was a fine horseman; and as he charged with three other horsemen into the enemy ranks—they had been instructed to charge together for mutual support—some of them seized his lance so he could not use it, and others slashed at him with their broadswords (maquahuitl), wounding him severely. Then they slashed at his mare, cutting her head at the neck so that it only hung by the skin. The mare fell dead, and if his mounted comrades had not come to Moron's rescue, he would probably have been killed also.”\n    -Bernal Díaz del Castillo, _The Conquest of New Spain_. 1623.\n     trans. J.M.Cohen, 1963.

When fresh it is filled with a white almost transparent, sweet, jelly-like pulp in which lies a rather large, shining, brown seed; the pulp is of a delicious sub-acid flavour when fresh. The Chinese dry it when it becomes black like a prune and thus preserve it for use throughout the year; in this state it is frequently to be seen in the London fruit shops.”\n    -John Smith, _A Dictionary of Popular Names of the Plants which Furnish the Natural and Acquired Wants of Man, in All Matters of Domestic and General Economy: Their History, Products, & Uses_. 1882.

# mottled dragon armour=Armour made from the scales of a mottled dragon.

# rambutan:quote=“The rambutan (_nephelium lappaceum_) is a beautiful fruit to which I have already alluded, as resembling the mammoth arbutus; and you suppose them at first, when at a little distance from you, a delicious dish of some tropical strawberry. But you find on inquiring into the ‘particulars within’ the outer coat, that there is concealed beneath the red and hairy covering a semi-transparent pulp of a pleasant acid taste, enveloping a single oval and oblong seed. I know not but I am peculiar in my memory of the beautiful fruits of the straits, but none lingers in my recollection so sweetly in its clustered beauties of the fruit-dish as the bearded and rosy rambutan.”\n    -Fitch Waterman Taylor, _A Voyage Round the World And Visits to Various Foreign Countries, in the United States Frigate Columbia_. 1847.

scimitar=Uma espada longa com uma lâmina curva.

Andrew Hurley.
# scroll of acquirement=This wonderful scroll causes the creation of a valuable item, with the reader choosing the type of item to be created. Items produced are heavily biased towards something fitting the reader's skills, and also towards gear that hasn't been seen yet, but, alas, nothing is guaranteed.
# scroll of amnesia=This scroll allows its reader to selectively erase one spell from memory to recapture the magical energy bound up with it.
# scroll of blinking=This scroll allows its reader to teleport a short distance, with precise control. Be wary that controlled teleports will cause the subject to become contaminated with magical energy.
# scroll of curse armour=This scroll places a curse on a worn piece of armour.
# scroll of curse jewellery=This scroll places a curse on an equipped amulet or a ring.
# scroll of curse weapon=This scroll places a curse on a wielded weapon.
# scroll of enchant armour=This scroll places an enchantment on a piece of armour. Most armour can only be enchanted to +2, except for shields which can be enchanted to +3, and body armour and bardings which can be enchanted up to the same value as their base AC.\n\nIt can also be used to enchant the hides of certain exotic creatures.
# scroll of enchant weapon i=This scroll places an enchantment on the wielded weapon, making it more accurate in combat. It becomes increasingly less likely to succeed when used on highly enchanted weapons, and can only ever enchant them up to +9. Magical artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.
# scroll of enchant weapon ii=This scroll places an enchantment on the wielded weapon, making it inflict greater damage in combat. It becomes increasingly less likely to succeed when used on highly enchanted weapons, and can only ever enchant them up to +9. Magical artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.
# scroll of enchant weapon iii=This scroll enchants the wielded weapon to be far more effective in combat, increasing both accuracy and damage. It becomes increasingly less likely to succeed when used on highly enchanted weapons, and can only ever enchant them up to +9. Magical artefacts cannot be enchanted at all.
# scroll of fear=This scroll causes great fear in those who see the one who reads it.
# scroll of fog=This scroll surrounds the reader with a dense cloud of fog.
# scroll of holy word=This scroll calls on the powers of Heaven to cause great damage to any nearby unholy creature — including you!
# scroll of identify=This useful magic scroll allows you to determine the properties of any object, and will occasionally allow multiple identifications.\n\nIf used on a deck of cards, this scroll will also give away the top card.
# scroll of immolation=This scroll is treated with an incredibly flammable substance, which explodes violently when the scroll is opened and read, scorching the reader and anything else nearby.
# scroll of magic mapping=This scroll reveals the surroundings of the one who reads it.
# scroll of noise=This prank scroll, often slipped into a wizard's backpack by a devious apprentice, causes a loud noise. It is not otherwise noted for its usefulness.
# scroll of random uselessness=It is easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of this scroll by the sense of achievement you get from getting it to work at all.
# scroll of recharging=This scroll restores the charges of any magical wand or rod chosen by its reader. When used on a rod, it also increases the size of the rod's power storage, increases the rate at which it regenerates power, and even improves its melee combat qualities.
# scroll of remove curse=Reading this scroll removes curses from the items you are using.
# scroll of unholy creation=This scroll draws unformed lumps of flesh from the Abyss to create a terrible beast.
# scroll of teleportation=Reading the words on this scroll translocates you to a random position after a short delay.
# scroll of torment=This scroll calls on the powers of darkness to inflict great pain on any nearby creature — including you! This halves the resilience of all living creatures, although is never directly fatal.
# scroll of vorpalise weapon=This scroll enchants the wielded weapon so as to make it far more effective at inflicting harm on its wielder's enemies. Using it on a weapon already affected by some kind of permanent branding is not advised. On the other hand, the scroll can make permanent the temporary branding of weapons obtained from some spells.\n\nBrands that are closely tied to one of the gods (Trog, Lugonu, Kikubaaquadgha, the Shining One) cannot be affixed this way. Xom, on the other hand, wouldn't let such an opportunity for fun go to waste.
# scroll of vulnerability=This scroll cancels all magical enchantments from the reader and from beings in the vicinity. Also, the magical resistances of the reader and nearby beings are halved for a short duration. The latter effect does not apply to beings fully immune to magic.
# scroll of silence=This scroll eliminates all sound near the reader. This makes reading scrolls, casting spells, praying or yelling in the reader's vicinity impossible. (It applies to the reader, too, of course.)\n\nThis silence will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very wrong. Silence starts out with a radius covering half the normal vision range, which will then shrink, eventually covering only the reader, before the effect times out.\n\nNote that demons do not need sound to cast spells; certain necromantic fixtures have this property as well.
scythe=Uma ferramenta do campo, normalmente inútil em combate.
# scythe:quote=“It was instinct. Illogical as lightning striking and not hurting. Each day the grain must be cut. It had to be cut. Why? Well, it just did, that was all. He laughed at the scythe in his big hands. Then, whistling, he took it out to the ripe and waiting field and did the work. He thought himself a little mad. Hell, it was an ordinary-enough wheat field, really, wasn't it?”\n    -Ray Bradbury, _The Scythe_. 1943.

The Dagda betook himself to his knowledge and learning, and therefore frankincense and myrrh and herbs were put around the body of Cermait, and he lifted Cermait on his back, and bearing Cermait he searched the world, and came to the great eastern world.\n He met three men going the road and the way with their father’s treasures. The Dagda asked news of them, and they said ‘We are three sons of one father and mother, and we are sharing our father’s treasures.’\n ‘What have ye?’ said the Dagda.\n ‘A shirt and a staff and a cloak,’ said they.\n ‘What virtues have these?’ said the Dagda.\n ‘This great staff that thou seest,’ said he, ‘has a smooth end and a rough end.

This memory, which at first calmed him, ended by tormenting him. He feared lest his son should meditate on this abnormal privilege and by some means find out he was a mere simulacrum.

I have shed my breeches;\n They were old and patched; but that won't prevent me\n From putting them on if I have a mind to.\n I shall probably find it just as easy\n To deal with your Trollish way of living.\n I can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;\n An oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.\n But to know that one never can get one's freedom —\n Not even to die as a human being —\n To end one's days as a Troll of the mountains —\n Never go back, as you tell me plainly —\n That is a thing that I'll not submit to.”\n    -Henrik Ibsen, _Peer Gynt_ . 1867.
