Dungeon=この奇怪な場所が如何にして創造されたのかは、未だに謎に包まれている。あるものは無聊な神々の遊び場であると言い、またあるものは地上を捨て、光の下を去った者達が創りだしたのだと言う。その由来がなんであれ、この大洞窟には多くの財宝があり、それを狙う侵入者への試練が満ち溢れている。極少数は生きて脱出することが叶ったが、一方では正気を失いこのダンジョンでの出来事を口にするしかできなくなってしまったものもいる。\n\nこのダンジョンは27の階層から成るが、真実それは始まりに過ぎないのだ。
Temple=ここは神々を祀った寺院であり、ダンジョンの狂気からの安全な避難所である。ここには大抵の場合、主立った神々の祭壇が設置されている。諸宗派の寺院はダンジョンの4階から7階の間にある。
Orcish Mines=ここはオーク族の所有する良質な金鉱だ。その曲がりくねった坑道はオークと人間の奴隷、新たに採掘した金で溢れかえっている。商魂たくましい商人たちはオークたちから金を搾取するための交易所を設けている。オークたちが無計画に坑道を広げた結果、複雑で簡単に閉じ込められかねないほど不安定な空間が生み出されている。\n\nオークの坑道は4の階層からなり、エルフの大広間への入り口と繋がっている。
Elven Halls=多くのエルフ族はこのような薄暗い地下に根城を構えたりはしない、この場所の主は闇エルフだ。この大広間には多くの財宝があるが、この場所に侵入する者は闇エルフたちの超越した魔力に注意せねばならない。\n\nエルフの大広間は3の階層から成る。
Dwarven Hall=この緻密な石造りの大広間はdeep dwarvesの居住地だ。彼らの卓越した金属加工技術は彼らがあなたのような侵入者へ振るう数多の武器の鍛造を可能としている。\n\nドワーフの大広間は単独の階層から成る
Lair=多くの冒険者は周囲の環境の急激な変化にそこが獣の巣窟であることに気づくだろう。実際、ここには利器を扱うのではなく、牙をつきたて、爪で切り裂き、獲物を食い散らかす何者かがいる。\n\n獣の棲み処は8の階層からなり、3の分岐を含んでいる。
Swamp=この沼の多い荒廃した土地はヘドロや汚物に塗れ、ハエや獲物を狙う大型の肉食獣に溢れかえっている。\n\n沼は5の階層からなり、ここにはゾットの腐敗のルーンがある。ダンジョンには蛇穴、沼、浅瀬、蜘蛛の巣の中から2つの分岐が現れる。もし沼が現れる場合、獣の棲み処の2階から5階の間に入り口が現れる。
Shoals=遠くから規則正しい波の音が聞こえ、磯の香りがする。浅瀬に着けば、あなたは広大な海の中に幾つかの島々を見渡せる別世界のような地下海岸に感銘を受けるだろう。突然、身の毛のよだつ叫びが大気を震わせ、ゴボゴボという音が聞こえてくる。不安になったあなたは周囲を見渡し、疑問に思うだろう。どちらが捕食者で、どちらが獲物なのかと……\n\n浅瀬は5の階層からなり、ここにはゾットのbarnacledのルーンがある。ダンジョンには蛇穴、沼、浅瀬、蜘蛛の巣の中から2つの分岐が現れる。もし浅瀬が現れる場合、獣の棲み処の3階から6階の間に入り口が現れる。
Snake Pit=蛇の巣窟であり、ナーガの棲み処だ。\n\n蛇穴は5の階層からなり、ここにはゾットの蛇行のルーンがある。ダンジョンには蛇穴、沼、浅瀬、蜘蛛の巣の中から2つの分岐が現れる。もし蛇穴が現れる場合、獣の棲み処の3階から6階の間に入り口が現れる。
Spider Nest=地上において、蜘蛛は歩いているうちに踏みつぶしてしまうものである。しかし、この大洞窟においてはそうではない。もしあなたが既に蜘蛛恐怖症でなくとも、崩れかけで蜘蛛の巣だらけの洞窟が、有毒の節足動物と這いまわる虫たちが、あなたを恐怖の虜にしてくれるだろう。\n\n蜘蛛の巣は5の階層からなり、ここにはゾットのgossamerのルーンがある。ダンジョンには蛇穴、沼、浅瀬、蜘蛛の巣の中から2つの分岐が現れる。もし蜘蛛の巣が現れる場合、獣の棲み処の3階から6階の間に入り口が現れる。
# Slime Pits=The amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Any trace of intelligent beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are rumours of great treasures deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers without door or window for acid to leak in.\n\nThe Slime Pits are six levels deep and contain the slimy rune. The entry is between Lair:6 and Lair:8.
# Vaults=Possibly constructed by some powerful madman, the Vaults are said to be home to great treasures. The blood spattered liberally around the entrance suggests that there is a certain amount of violence, too.\n\nThe Vaults are five levels deep and contain the silver rune, as well as the entrances to two more branches. The entrance can be found between levels 15 and 20 of the main dungeon.
# Hall of Blades=Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and beast. That time is no more, yet the weapons are still there.\n\nThe Hall of Blades is a single level and can be found between Vault:4 and Vault:6.
# Crypt=A huge repository for the ancient dead. The air is chill and fetid, the walls cold and damp. Bones are strewn liberally everywhere and the whole place resounds with the keening of the tortured souls of the unquiet dead.\n\nThe Crypt is five levels deep and can be found between Vault:2 and Vault:4. It contains the entrance to the Tomb.
# Tomb=The Tomb of the Ancients is a place of damnation, of horrors animated by the vilest necromancy. Honest creatures of the surface turn pale at the mere mention of its name. The list of those who have returned from this place of pure death is exceedingly short.\n\nThe Tomb is three levels deep and contains the golden rune. Its entry is either on Crypt:2 or Crypt:3.
# Tomb:quote=“In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror, imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain.”\n    -Nathaniel Hawthorne, &quot;The Haunted Mind&quot;. 1835.
# Hell=The hallway to the four hells is guarded by Geryon. Heroes who prove their worth in the vestibule and blow Geryon's horn may explore the different regions of Hell: Dis, Gehenna, Cocytus and Tartarus.\n\nPortals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the deeper parts of the main dungeon.
# Dis=The Iron City of Dis. Who will stand the test of iron?\n\nDis is seven levels deep and contains the iron rune. It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
# Gehenna=The fires of Gehenna have burnt many a confident hero, and they will burn evermore.\n\nGehenna is seven levels deep and contains the obsidian rune. It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
# Cocytus=A grim and frost-bitten wasteland.\n\nCocytus is seven levels deep and contains the icy rune. It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
# Tartarus=A decaying netherworld. Over time, the undead, demons and devils of this place drain all life out of treasure-craving visitors.\n\nTartarus is seven levels deep and contains the bone rune. It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
# Zot=A region of the dungeon that is so terrifying, so full of madness, frenzy and lunacy, that it has been locked securely against random trespassers. Only the most demented adventurers would dare gather the required keys, break the seal and penetrate deeper — all in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no one has ever laid eyes on before.\n\nThe Realm of Zot is five levels deep and can only be entered when carrying at least three runes.
# Forest=Tha trees be attackin'!
# Abyss=The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted. It is filled with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature, whose common aim is to feast on intruders. It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight in sending would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness. Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct schemes around this place and its denizens.\n\nThe Abyss consists of five infinite levels. The abyssal rune can be found from the third level onwards, and is more common at greater depths. The Abyss can be purposefully reached through portals in the deeper levels of the main dungeon.
# Pandemonium=Pandemonium is an infinite realm of pain and suffering. While you can find a good deal of loot there, all these treasures are guarded by demons and even crueller demon lords. Many a hero, confusing confidence with megalomania, has died screaming in the barrage of torment and hellfire.\n\nPandemonium is endless. Portals there are found abundantly in the deeper parts of the main dungeon. Note that getting back might be more difficult.\n\nNo fewer than five runes can be found in Pandemonium:\n • a fiery rune in the well-heated realm of Cerebov\n • a glowing rune in the contaminated domain of Mnoleg\n • a magical rune guarded by the arcane powers of Lom Lobon and his minions\n • a dark rune in the shadowy abode of Gloorx Vloq\n • demonic runes exist in multiple copies, owned by less famous lords
# Ziggurat=A ziggurat is a strange tower constructed of twenty seven levels of incrementally larger combat arenas, each containing greater wealth and even greater danger than the last. Whatever entity created this monstrosity charges a steep price for entry. Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the faint of heart: even the bravest and most skilled adventurers have met their ends in one. While a portal to safety will be present on every level, once left, a ziggurat cannot be re-entered.
# Labyrinth=The Labyrinth is a large, complex maze designed by subtle and malicious minds for reasons long lost to history. Old stories say that the labyrinth was constructed as a prison for a fearsome minotaur. More recent stories say this beast dwells there still, guarding the labyrinth's sole exit — as well as a hoard of treasure taken from the bodies of the foolish adventurers who got lost inside and starved to death. Take care inside the shifting, twisting passages of this labyrinth, or your own possessions may end up in the minotaur's treasure pile.
# Bazaar=While some merchants set up shop in the dungeon, others travel in caravans from place to place. The bazaars of these intinerant traders feature a number of different shops and often have better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain.\n\nAlso be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.
# Trove=Once upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard, terrified of being caught committing an act of burglary, created a system of portals leading into the secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to loot them himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone who wanted to rifle through them. A clever artificer, he designed his portals to direct the entrant to the trove most suited to their needs.\n\nThe items inside this trove are likely to be useful, but beware: the wizard is long dead, and even while alive he never offered a money-back guarantee.
# Sewer=Every inhabited place needs to dispose of its waste products. The Dungeon too has its stinking sewers and drains, full of filthy water and ignored by most but used as hideaways by the disgusting and the desperate. Old tales speak of dangerous creatures stalking through the foul-smelling green water, preying on each other without mercy. The tales also allude to valuable items accidentally washed into the drainage tunnels, forgotten and left to grow mouldy in the damp caverns.
# Ossuary=The Ossuary is a smallish tomb containing the remains and grave goods of some distant relatives of the pharaohs, along with the corpses of their retainers and household animals. It is undoubtedly riddled with many traps, and its undead denizens are unlikely to take kindly to looting.
# Bailey=The Bailey is the still-occupied and well-guarded fortress of an orcish lord. In it his private treasures are protected by both physical barriers and large numbers of well armed humanoid warriors.
# Ice Cave=A desolate cavern shaped from solid ice and filled with the echoes of bestial howls. The intricate carvings and statues which once lined its walls have been warped and obscured by centuries of slow melting and refreezing.
# Volcano=Built from enormous blocks of obsidian, this sweltering chamber may once have served as a temple to some strange deity, or perhaps the dwelling of a mighty fire giant. The air shimmers with oppressive heat, and the dull roar of the volcano's heart never ceases.
# Wizlab=In ages past, the most powerful mages — many of whom you may have heard of — would frequently find or construct small realms sealed off from the rest of the world, where they could isolate themselves in the pursuit of ever-greater magical knowledge and power. The mages are long gone, but many of their arcane laboratories still exist, filled with the results of their experiments. Those willing to explore these laboratories may find powerful magical treasure, but be warned: the wizards to whom these labs belonged to deserved their reputations.
